# ClimaCell Postman Collection
This quickstart is a step-by-step guide that will get you up and running with Postman and the ClimaCell  [Postman Collection](https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/collections/intro-to-collections/).

If you are looking for a more in-depth guide and reference for the ClimaCell API, please refer to the [ClimaCell API documentation](https://docs.climacell.co/reference).

## Getting started
Follow these steps to quickly get started with the [ClimaCell API](https://docs.climacell.co):

1. [Sign up](https://climacell.co/platforms) with ClimaCell to get a set of API keys that are required for interacting with the API.
2. Download and install the [Postman app](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/)
3. Import ["ClimaCell Postman Collection"](https://github.com/ClimaCell-API/climacell-postman/blob/main/ClimaCell%20Postman%20Collection.json) file or click the button below to install the ClimaCell Postman collection!
4. Import ["ClimaCell Production Environment"](https://github.com/ClimaCell-API/climacell-postman/blob/main/ClimaCell%20Production%20Environment.json) file and add your `apikey` that you grabbed from our [Development Section](https://app.climacell.co)
5. Change the query/path/body parameters by going to the "Pre-request Script" tab and modifying them

## Collection endpoints
The following collection is a fully-featured set of pre-filled requests that allow you to test the [ClimacCell API](https://docs.climacell.co/reference), and visualize the responses in a friendly format.
* [Timeline (GET/POST)](https://docs.climacell.co/reference/timeline-overview)
* [Events (GET/POST)](https://docs.climacell.co/reference/events-overview)
* [Route (POST)](https://docs.climacell.co/reference/route-overview)
* [Map â€º Tile (GET)](https://docs.climacell.co/reference/map-overview)
* [Locations](https://docs.climacell.co/reference/locations-overview)
* [Insights](https://docs.climacell.co/reference/insights-overview)
* [Alerts](https://docs.climacell.co/reference/alerts-overview)

## Useful Tools
[JSON to CSV](https://json-csv.com/) can be used to transform a timeline to an CSV - just make sure to flatten the values before using the one-liner js code below and change RESPONSE to the one you got from our API.

```
(RESPONSE).data.timelines[0].intervals.map(obj => Object.assign({}, ...function _flatten(o) { return [].concat(...Object.keys(o).map(k => typeof o[k] === 'object' ? _flatten(o[k]) : ({[k]: o[k]})))}(obj)))
```

[Plotly Chart Studio](https://plotly.com/chart-studio/) can be used to plot the data points. Simply convert a response to .csv (as mentioned above), import, inspect and share.

[Webhook Tester](https://webhook.site/) can be used for receiving webhook calls. Generate a webhook url on this site and use that url in the developers section to get alert notifications.
